# Wellkept never goes to the Mac App Store (guideline 2.4.5 forbids most of what it does), so
# Apple's blessing arrives a different way: the app is signed with a Developer ID certificate, sent
# to Apple's notary service, and the resulting ticket is *stapled* into the app and the disk image.
# Stapling is the part people forget — without it a Mac that is offline, or behind a captive
# portal, refuses to open the app.

#   bin/release.sh --dry-run    # print what it would do
#
# Escape hatch, for when the gate is the thing that is broken:
#   SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1 bin/release.sh
#
# This will not be run for a while. It exists now so that the first release is not invented under
# pressure at the end of a long day.
